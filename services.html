						<h3>Tree felling</h3>
						<p>We always prefer to retain trees where possible, however when removal is necessary you can be assured that your trees will be brought down safely and efficiently, with the area left spotlessly clean after the job is complete.  Our arborists can also advise you on the life expectancy of your trees, so you can plan ahead, if need be.</p>
						<p>Your tree may need removing if it is:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Dead or diseased;</li>
							<li>Storm damaged;</li>
							<li>In a dangerous or unstable condition; or</li>
							<li>Planted in an inappropriate position given its’ current or potential growth size.</li>

						<h3>Pruning & shaping</h3>
						<p>ACT Tree Felling are experts when it comes to pruning trees and it is a service we really pride ourselves on.  There are many benefits to pruning a tree correctly and we always prune to the highest standard, with an understanding of tree biology and the variance of species characteristics.</p>
						<p>Correct pruning can reduce the wind resistance of your trees, lessening the chance of branch failure.</p>

						<p>Your trees may require pruning if they have:</p>
						<ul>
						    <li>Excessive end weight (the amount of foliage concentrated towards the end of branches);</li>
						    <li>Structural defects such as inclusions, cavities, rot or diseases;</li>
						    <li>Lower branches that require clearing to allow for pedestrian or mower access.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Or pruning may be beneficial in order to:</p>
						<ul>
						    <li>Allow more light to penetrate to your garden or grass;</li>
						    <li>Remove large limbs hanging over your house;</li>
						    <li>Remove dead wood or diseased branches;</li>
						    <li>Clear from power lines, other structures or buildings.</li>
						</ul>

                        <h3>Dead-wooding</h3>
                        <p>Dead wooding is the process of selectively removing the dead, dying and diseased branches from trees.  If dead wood is removed on a regular basis, a tree remains in good condition, puts on more growth and generally has a longer and healthier life.</p>
                        <p>This service provides numerous benefits including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increasing the safety of the area surrounding the tree;</li>
                            <li>Promoting positive health of the tree by stimulating new growth;</li>
                            <li>Reducing the amount of leaf material, as a surplus of material can encourage insect infestation and/or the spread of disease;</li>
                            <li>Maintaining the aesthetic appeal of the tree.</li>

                        <p>With almost 40 years experience working in the tree industry in Canberra, ACT Tree Felling have developed a reputation as the best local business for removal of difficult, large and/or dangerous trees.</p>
                        <p>We can honestly say that there is not a tree in Canberra that we would not be able to remove.</p>
                        <p>We will organise the safest way to complete these difficult jobs, often involving traffic management and the use of cranes.  We strive to provide a safe working environment for our customers and ourselves.</p>
                        <p>We are fully equipped with the most advanced tree care equipment to ensure the job is done right and in a safe and timely manner.</p>

                        <p>All home owners in the ACT are required by law to ensure their trees are clear from power and service lines.  Sometimes trees growing too close to power lines can cause blackouts, create safety hazards such as grass fires and bushfires, and increase the risk of electrocution.</p>
                        <p>Our staff are trained to work around live power lines, so most of the time you won’t need to have the power turned off to clear your trees from the lines.  In cases where a power outage is required, we will arrange the whole process for you in cooperation with ActewAGL.</p>
                        <p>You can rest assured that we are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ActewAGL qualified to the highest level, to work with trees around power lines;</li>
                            <li>Fully trained by TAFE NSW in Vegetation Management;</li>
                            <li>All employees are trained and re-assessed yearly to maintain these qualifications and keep up-to-date with changes and new methods of work.</li>

                        <h3>Cable and bracing</h3>
                        <p>Trees are very beneficial to our environment and add enormous value to our homes and places of work.  They may also have sentimental value for some customers, who may wish to retain their trees at all costs.</p>
                        <p>However sometimes trees with multiple trunks, or what we call ‘co-dominant stems’, can become structurally defective and ‘failure’ at this type of branch union is quite common.</p>
                        <p>ACT Tree Felling can inspect your trees, assess them for any structural weakness and then recommend the best type of cable or bracing system for your situation.  The result?  You can retain the trees you love and sleep well at night knowing that they, you and your property are safe.</p>
                        <p>There are three major reasons for cable and bracing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prevention - to reduce the chance of failure on a healthy tree with structural weakness;</li>
                            <li>Restoration - to prolong the existence of a damaged tree;</li>
                            <li>Mitigation - to reduce the hazard potential of a tree.</li>

                        <p>Tree stumps can be unsightly, obtrusive and hazardous. Stump grinding is the most efficient and cost-effective solution to removing unwanted stumps from your property, to prevent re-growth and the spread of tree disease.</p>

                            <li>Unsightly in grassed areas; and</li>
                            <li>Full-grown trees again in future.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We also offer a wood chipping service where we can put all your branches/cuttings through our chipper, then either take away the mulched material or leave on-site for you to apply to your garden</p>

                        <p>If you are worried about your tree’s structural health, life expectancy, falling or overhanging limbs or something else that just doesn’t look quite right, a detailed tree inspection by one of our arborists will help ease your mind.  Our consultation will identify key issues or concerns in relation to your tree, giving you verbal advice in an easy-to-understand manner.  We will outline the What, Why and How of the overall state of your tree.  Our advice will also give an overall recommendation on tree retention, removal and tree replacement options.</p>
                        <p>Need something in writing?  We can provide a documented tree report that clearly identifies problems that may exist in your trees and give details for any work that is recommended be done.</p>
                        <p>We offer two types of tree reports:</p>
                        <ul>
                        	<li>INDIVIDUAL TREE HEALTH REPORTS – Mainly requested by private home owners, real estate agents or Government departments, to manage the health of an individual tree; these reports are also often used to assist in obtaining Government/Council approval to remove trees.</li>
                        	<li>ASSET MANAGEMENT, TREE HEALTH AND RISK ASSESMENT REPORTS – Typically requested by Body Corporate managers, Government Organisations, School Committees and other facilities who manage public recreation or amenity spaces.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you are planning tree removal or tree pruning that requires council approval, we can prepare and submit the application on your behalf, and if necessary, provide supporting documentation and a tree report to go along with the application.</p>
